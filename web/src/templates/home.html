  <div class='divider'><span>Our Proposition</span></div>
  <p>After the pandemic struck the world in 2019, the way people work and study was changed forever. Many workers and students find themselves at home with little or no actual social contact, and studies have shown that this leads to conditions such as anxiety or depression. Thus, we feel that Therabot is just what the stay-home workers and students need.</p>
