  <div class='body'> <p>Therabot is a personal therapy robot that aims to create a social atmosphere and make the customer feel as if they have a close companion at home. Using voice recognition and synthesis, customers will be able to communicate to Therabot and hopefully feel as if they're talking to an actual person instead of a program. Therabot is designed for stay-home workers and students to help them feel connected while being socially distant.</p>
