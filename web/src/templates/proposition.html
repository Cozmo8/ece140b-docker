    <p>After the pandemic struck the world in 2019, the way people work and study was changed forever. Many workers and students find themselves "social distancing" by working at home with little social contact, and studies have shown that this leads to conditions such as anxiety and depression. Thus, Therabot was created to solve these problems and help the public stay happy while staying home.</p>
  
    <p> We believe that students and remote employees will use a therapeutic desk robot friend because it will give them the social interaction and support they are missing. Unlike Amazon's Alexa and Google Home, our product aims to be more interactive and personalized. With Therabot, you can socially distance without feeling the negative effects of anxiety and depression. </p></div>
