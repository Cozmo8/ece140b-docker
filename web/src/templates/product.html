  <br><div class='divider'><span>About Our Product</span></div>
  <div class='body'><p>Our product, Therabot, is a personal therapy robot that aims to create a social atmosphere and make the customer feel as if they have a close companion at home. Using voice recognition and synthesis, customers will be able to communicate to Therabot and hopefully feel as if they're talking to an actual person instead of a program. Therabot is designed for stay-home workers and students to help them feel connected while being socially distant.</p>

  <p>This product includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Speech recognition and synthesis</li>
    <li>A small display for facial expressions</li>
    <li>Personalized mood tracking</li>
    <li>Customization for its appearance and responses</li>
    <li>And more to come!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For our product user interface, we aim to have an app that allows users to configure Therabot. For example, you can change between several moods so that Therabot can perfectly fit our customer's needs. Also, we hope to have cosmetic customization options for our product, so customers can personlize him the way they want.</p>
